              Early Life & Education: Herbert Hoover was born on August 10, 1874, in West Branch, Iowa. He was the son of Jesse Hoover, a blacksmith, and Hulda Minthorn Hoover, a seamstress and Quaker minister. He had two siblings and grew up in a modest, hardworking Quaker household. He graduated from Stanford University in 1895 with a degree in geology. Before entering politics, he became a successful mining engineer, working in Australia and China, and gained international recognition for leading the Commission for Relief in Belgium during World War I. The early deaths of his parents and his Quaker upbringing instilled in him a strong sense of discipline, self-reliance, and humanitarianism.

              Political Alignment & Election: Hoover was a member of the Republican Party. His campaign platform focused on economic prosperity, efficiency in government, and maintaining Prohibition. The U.S. was experiencing economic growth and optimism during the 1920s, but underlying financial instability and concerns about Prohibition and religion influenced the election. He ran against Democrat Al Smith in the 1928 election, with key issues including Prohibition, religion (Smith was Catholic), and economic policy. Hoover won in a landslide, securing 444 electoral votes to Smith’s 87, with strong support in rural and Protestant areas.

              Presidency: His major accomplishments included expanding public works projects, such as the Hoover Dam, and reforming the federal prison system. His presidency was defined by the Great Depression, which began in 1929, leading to massive unemployment and economic collapse. He is most famous for his response to the Great Depression, which many criticized as inadequate, though he did initiate some government relief efforts. Controversial moments included the handling of the Bonus Army protest in 1932, where World War I veterans demanding early payments were forcibly removed from Washington, D.C. He did not serve more than one term, as he lost the 1932 election to Franklin D. Roosevelt due to public dissatisfaction with his handling of the Depression.
